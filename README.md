# JavaAPCSA Section 4 Practice

## Overview
This repository contains solutions for Section 4 practice problems in Java APCSA. The practice is divided into two parts:  
- **Part A**: Writing methods  
- **Part B**: Processing a name  

## Part A - Writing Methods

### Problem 1: Writing Methods
In this practice, you'll implement methods that perform the following tasks:

1. **Convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius**  
   Formula: `C = 5/9 * (F - 32)`

2. **Compute the hypotenuse of a triangle**  
   Formula: `c = √(b² + a²)`

3. **Simulate the rolling of two 6-sided dice and display their sum**

### Tasks
#### Task 1
Define the following methods in `ComputeMethods.java`:

```java
public double fToC(double degreesF)
public double hypotenuse(int a, int b)
public int roll()
